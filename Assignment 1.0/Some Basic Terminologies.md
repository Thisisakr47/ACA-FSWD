## **Client-Side & Server-Side**
- **Client-Side**
  It is the program which runs on client computer (browser) and deals with the user interface and any other processing that can happen on client computer like :- </b>
  * Sending request for data to server
  * Make interactive web pages
  * work as an interface between server and user etc.</b>
  Some common programming languages for Client-Side are : HTML, CSS & JavaScript.</b>

- **Server-Side**
  It is the program that runs on server dealing with the generation of content of web page like :-</b>
  * Access/Write a file on server   
  * Interact with other servers
  * Process user input</b>
  Some common programming languages for Server-Side are : C++, Python & PHP.</b>

## **HTTP**
 **HTTP**(**H**yper**T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol) is a protocol(system of rules that define how data is exchanged within/between computers) which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a **[client-server](#Client-Side-&-Server-Side)** protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.

## **HTTP** *vs* **HTTPS**
**HTTP** has been the most widely used protocol for data transfer over the Web but the data (i.e. hypertext) exchanged using *http* isnâ€™t as secure as the data exchanged (between Client & Server) using *http* goes as plain text, so anyone between server and client can read the data as it is not encrypted. Whereas, in *https*(**H**yper**T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol**H**yper **S**ecure) the data exchange between client-server is encrypted so a third person can't decipher the data exchanged between them. That's the reason why during Online Transactions the url changes to *https* from *http* to provide security to the clients.

## **Frameworks** *vs* **Libraries**
When we use a *library* such as jquery, we are in charge of the flow of the application. It's us who are choosing when and where to call the *library*.</b> 
Whereas when we use a *framework* such as django, the *framework* is in charge of the flow. It provides some places to plug in your code, but its the framework that calls the code we plugged in as needed.
