*****************************
## **What is this?**
- In this assignment I have listed down **[10 Basic CMD Commands](https://github.com/Thisisakr47/ACA-FSWD-2021/blob/main/Assignment%201.0/10%20Basic%20CMD%20Commands.md)** which everyone should know. 
- I have  also written **[Some Basic Terminologies](https://github.com/Thisisakr47/ACA-FSWD-2021/blob/main/Assignment%201.0/Some%20Basic%20Terminologies.md)** which contains a short discription on the topics *Clientside*, *Serverside*, *HTTP Protocols*, *HTTP vs HTTPS*, *Frameworks vs Libraries*.
